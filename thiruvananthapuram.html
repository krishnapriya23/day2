      <h1><b>THIRUVANANTHAPURAM</b></h1>
    <p>Thiruvananthapuram (or Trivandrum) is the capital of the southern Indian state of Kerala. It's distinguished by its British colonial architecture and many art galleries. It’s also home to Kuthira Malika (or Puthen Malika) Palace, adorned with carved horses and displaying collections related to the Travancore royal family, whose regional capital was here from the 18th–20th centuries</p>
    A gracious and evergreen city spread over seven hills, Thiruvananthapuram, capital of Kerala, is steeped in history and culture. Located in the extreme south of the state, its shores are washed by the warm waters of the Arabian Sea. This is a city where time moves gracefully with the day unfolding according to time honoured rhythms, qualities which make it one of the best cities in the country. Holding fort in the heart of the capital is Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple which is dedicated to Lord Vishnu who reclines on the serpent Anantha and after whom the city is named. Formerly called Trivandrum, the city’s original name was restored in 1991.

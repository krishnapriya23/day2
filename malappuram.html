      <h1><b>MALAPPURAM</b></h1>
    <p>Malappuram, is one of the 14 districts in the Indian state of Kerala, with a coastline of 70 km. It is the most populous district of Kerala, which is home to around 13% of the total population of the state. The district was formed on 16 June 1969, spanning an area of about 3,554 km².</p>
    There is much to see and savor around Malappuram. While Malappuram itself is situated about thirty kilometers from the Tirur railway station, Malappuram, the one-time headquarters of the militant Zamorins has much to offer sightseers.

    Pommani is a nearby port that is the sentinel of a rich heritage. It is located about twenty kilometers from the Kuttipuram junction of the railways. Padinjarekhara beach overlooks the coming together of the three water bodies of the Tirur Puzha, the Bharathapuzha and the Arabian Sea.
    
    The Huma Ath Mosque is the largest among about fifty mosques present in the area and is visited by many.
    
    The Trikavu Durga Temple is famous for its resplendent Navrathri celebrations while the Mookuthala Bhagrathi Temple is another one of the famous Durga temples. It is located about a hundred kilometers towards the south-East of Ponnani. It is said that the Shankaracharya had established the temple. The temple has an annual festival during November and December or Vrischikam and is called the Karthika Mahotsav. Another exciting place is the boat race conducted at Biyyam Kayal backwaters. This is an annual event held during Onam.
    
    A major Muslim pilgrimage which has been celebrated as the ‘Mecca of the East’ is the Ponnani Juma Masjid. The annual festival called the Nercha is celebrated during March and April every year for four days. The mosque was built for the Sufi Saint Malik Ibn Dinar as he had been the first preacher of Islam to Kerala.</p>
